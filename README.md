How can linear algebra can be applied to clinical bioinformatics using cosine similarity?

This project shows how linear algebra can be applied to clinical bioinformatics. Using cosine similarity, we can measure how similar the gene expression profiles of different patients are. This approach is widely used in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and patient stratification in hospitals and research institutes.


Represent each patientâ€™s expression profile as a vector.

Compute the cosine similarity between all pairs of patients.

Visualize the results as a similarity matrix / heatmap.

cos(Î¸)= (vector a* vector b)/(a length's vector* b length's vector)


Interpretation (clinical context)

High cosine similarity (
â‰ˆ1
â‰ˆ1) â†’ patients have similar gene expression patterns.

Low cosine similarity (
â‰ˆ0
â‰ˆ0) â†’ patients show unrelated expression patterns.

Negative similarity (
<0
<0) â†’ patients have opposite expression trends.

ðŸ‘‰ This is clinically relevant to:

Identify subgroups of patients with similar tumor biology.

Support clustering and precision medicine approaches.

Compare healthy vs. diseased tissue profiles.
