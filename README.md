How can linear algebra can be applied to clinical bioinformatics using cosine similarity?

This project shows how linear algebra can be applied to clinical bioinformatics. Using cosine similarity, we can measure how similar the gene expression profiles of different patients are. This approach is widely used in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and patient stratification in hospitals and research institutes.
